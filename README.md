# NFT-AML-codeï¼šFederated Learning for NFT Anti-Money Laundering

## Introduction

NFT-AML is a project that aims to combat money laundering in the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) space. We propose a novel federated learning approach called FedBoost to detect suspicious transactions involving NFTs. FedBoost combines the power of XGBoost algorithm for local anomaly detection on individual devices and federated learning with gradient aggregation optimization for global model training. Our project is currently being developed for the Citi Innovation Contest.
